This application lets you select an area on the screen and copy it to 
the Gnome clipboard.

It was developed and it is used in the Math lab of "Universidad Don 
Bosco" (El Salvador) :).

I used a lot of code from gnome-screenshot, so thanks a lot to the people that 
contributed to it, namely Jonathan Blandfordh and Cosimo Cecchi according to 
the source code header.
